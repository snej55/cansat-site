            <h1><b>Andrew’s Reflective Revolution</b></h1>
            <br />
            Andrew the geographer, clever and wise, <br />
            Observed the heat rising, scorching the skies.< br />
            “The earth’s warming fast, we must take action, <br />
            To reflect the sun’s rays is my bald satisfaction!”<br />
            <br></br>
            He shaved his head clean, not a hair left to see, <br />
            “A mirror,” he declared, “for the sun’s UV spree! < br />
            This bald, shiny dome will bounce back the radiation, <br />
            A simple yet genius climate innovation.”<br />
            <br></br>
            With his radiant scalp reflecting each ray, <br />
            Andrew began changing the world day by day.< br />
            He inspired a movement, a glistening brigade, <br />
            Bald heads united, their effort well - made.< br />
            <br></br>
            “Together,” said Andrew, “we’ll turn down the heat, <br />
            With courage and chrome, our mission’s complete.”<br />
            And so, with each step, his vision shone bright, <br />
            A shimmering beacon in the climate fight.< br />

                        In the quiet classroom, where soft light gently gleams,<br/>
            Stands Richard, humble, lost in life's serene dreams.<br/>
            A biology teacher, with a spirit so kind and pure,<br/>
            He nurtures young minds, making knowledge secure.<br/>
            <br/>

            His laboratory, a sanctuary where thoughts take flight,<br/>

            In summer, the buzzing of insects at play.<br/>
            <br/>
            When autumn arrives with its leaves falling down,<br/>
            He teaches the cycle of life that abounds.<br/>

            Of food chains and webs, so intricately planned.<br/>

            Demonstrating how to plant seeds with love and pride.<br/>
            "Nurture them gently," he says with a patient smile,<br/>
            "Watch them grow strong—it's worth every while."<br/>
            <br/>
            He tells tales of scientists, their struggles and triumphs too,<br/>
            Of Darwin's long voyage on the Beagle so blue.<br/>
            Of Fleming's discovery that changed our world's fate,<br/>
            These stories of science he shares with great weight.<br/>

            Richard is there with a heart fully shown.<br/>
            He listens, understands, offers his hand to hold,<br/>
            Guiding them through life's mysteries to unfold.<br/>

            His classroom walls display projects fine and neat,<br/>
            Each one a testament to young minds replete.<br/>
            From cell models to life's tree so wide,<br/>
            Each one crafted with care, love, and pride.<br/>
            <br/>

            Always challenging them to see things anew,<br/>
            To question, explore, and follow truths through.<br/>

            In the quiet classroom, where soft light gently gleams,<br/>
            Stands Richard, humble, weaving life's serene dreams.<br/>
            A biology teacher, with spirit so kind and pure,<br/>
            He opens young minds, making knowledge secure.<br/>
            <br/>

            <h1>Jan's poem</h1>
            <br/>
            In the flickerin' glow of classroom lights so dim,<br/>
            Where dusty old textbooks gathered grim,<br/>
            Stood Mr. Nirmal, ruler in hand,<br/>
            A proper stern bloke, commandin' the land.<br/>
            His glasses perched on his nose just right,<br/>
            His tweed jacket buttoned up tight.<br/>
            The blackboard behind him was covered in sums,<br/>
            While the classroom sat quiet as drums.<br/>
            <br/>
            But there in the back, with a face so divine,<br/>
            Sat Jan Lukasiak, handsome and fine.<br/>
            His chiseled cheekbones caught the light,<br/>
            His piercing brown like beer eyes shone so bright.<br/>
            His dark wavy hair fell just so,<br/>
            A lock dangling down on his brow.<br/>
            His strong jawline clenched as he chewed,<br/>
            On his pen's plastic cap, looking bored and subdued.<br/>
            <br/>
            His maths book lay open, a canvas so bare,<br/>
            Awaitin' his touch, his artistic flair.<br/>
            The pages were crisp, the problems aligned,<br/>
            But Jan had much different plans in mind.<br/>
            With a flick of his pen and a stroke so bold,<br/>
            He transformed the pages, a story untold.<br/>
            His fingers moved quick with an artist's grace,<br/>
            A smirk played on his handsome face.<br/>
            <br/>
            The Pythagorean theorem, once proper and neat,<br/>
            Now sported a tache, lookin' dead cheeky and sweet.<br/>
            Old Pythagoras himself had a top hat in place,<br/>
            And a monocle drawn with such delicate trace.<br/>
            But oh, what a sight, with his face so fair,<br/>
            The girls in the class could only stare.<br/>
            Their eyes followed Jan, watching him work,<br/>
            As his pen danced and twirled with a mischievous quirk.<br/>
            <br/>
            Nirmal droned on, none the wiser, bless 'im,<br/>
            "Now class, pay attention, this next bit's quite grim."<br/>
            As Jan's pen danced, takin' the absolute mick,<br/>
            Turning old Euler into a right proper dick.<br/>
            The quadratic equations, once tidy and right,<br/>
            Now twisted and tangled, a proper sight.<br/>
            The parabolas sprouted little legs and feet,<br/>
            Dancing a jig to a sly rhythmic beat.<br/>
            <br/>
            His handsome face lit with a mischievous grin,<br/>
            As he doodled and drew, causin' a din.<br/>
            The sine and cosine, once waves so pure,<br/>
            Now danced with the devil, havin' a right laugh, for sure.<br/>
            The sine wave had arms and was wavin' hello,<br/>
            While cosine wore sunglasses, looking dead cool, yo.<br/>
            The graphs all came alive under Jan's clever hand,<br/>
            Living out adventures in this mathematical land.<br/>
            <br/>
            The classroom clock ticked, a slow, steady beat,<br/>
            Its hands moving round, never missing a beat.<br/>
            As Jan's masterpiece neared its deceit,<br/>
            His artwork so clever, so wicked, so neat.<br/>
            His face, so angelic, hid his cunning mind,<br/>
            A wolf in sheep's clothin', one of a kind.<br/>
            No one would suspect that this handsome young bloke,<br/>
            Had turned all their maths into one big joke.<br/>
            <br/>
            Nirmal turned, his gaze sweepin' the room,<br/>
            "Now then, who's ready to meet their doom?"<br/>
            But Jan's book lay shut, hidin' its bloom,<br/>
            His mischief concealed in that textbook tomb.<br/>
            With a face so innocent, a gleam in his eye,<br/>
            He looked like a saint, but oh what a lie.<br/>
            His long lashes fluttered, his lips pressed tight,<br/>
            Hiding all traces of his artistic delight.<br/>
            <br/>
            The bell finally rang, what a beautiful sound,<br/>
            As the students all filed out, homeward bound.<br/>
            They handed their books in, stacked with care,<br/>
            His handiwork hidden, a secret affair.<br/>
            But Nirmal would find, with a gasp and a stare,<br/>
            The chaos and genius that Jan left there.<br/>
            The teacher would clutch at his poor aching chest,<br/>
            At the sight of those equations, put to the test.<br/>
            <br/>
            The next day at school there was quite a scene,<br/>
            As students gathered to see what he'd mean.<br/>
            The book was displayed for the whole class to see,<br/>
            This mathematical madness, this anarchy.<br/>
            The girls all sighed at the work of his hand,<br/>
            This handsome young vandal, this mathematical man.<br/>
            While the lads all laughed at the drawings so bold,<br/>
            At the way that he twisted those theorems of old.<br/>
            <br/>
            So here's to Jan, with his face so fair,<br/>
            A maths book vandal, drivin' 'im spare.<br/>
            His legend now lives in the school's hallowed halls,<br/>
            The boy who turned maths into art on its walls.<br/>
            In the classroom of numbers, his legend will grow,<br/>
            A tale to be told of that cheeky young crow.<br/>
            A handsome genius, with a touch so bold and sly,<br/>
            A rebel, an artist, oh my, oh my.<br/>
            Innit just brilliant? What a guy, oh blimey!<br/>
            A proper laugh, mate, what a legend, what an eyeful!<br/>
            That Jan Lukasiak, he's one right proper lad,<br/>
            The best looking troublemaker that school ever had.<br/>
