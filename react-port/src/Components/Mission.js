            <h1>Our Mission</h1><br />
            
            CastAway is the team behind the CastAway satelite, our skybreaking attempt to prove that 
            the sky is indeed the limit. Consisting of six multitalented junior individuals, we have 
            designed a satelite to conduct various science experiments, while still meeting the design 
            criteria set by ESERO. The satelite is set to perform the following science experiments: <br />

            <ul>
                <li>Measure the air pressure in various points of the atmosphere, and attempt to infer 
                altitude from it.</li>
                <li>Measure the temperature of the air at various points of the atmosphere.</li>
                <li>Measure the quantity of different gases at various points of the atmosphere.</li>
                <li>Measure the light intensity for both visible and ultraviolet light that the satelite 
                experiences at different points of the atmosphere.</li>
                <li>Measure the strength and direction of Earth's magnetic field.</li>
                <li>Measure the direction and magnetude of orientation, rotation and direction of the 
                satelite.</li>
                <li>Measure the GPS position of the satelite relative to Earth in three dimensions.</li>
                <li>Take pretty pictures!</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            We need to have a near-constant steam of data sent to us over radio, and be able to recover 
            the satelite in a state where we can recover more data, and use it again. <br />
            <br />
            Another one of our objectives is to raise public awareness about our project, which we 
            are trying to achieve by: <br /><br />
            <ul>
                <li>Making this website.</li>
                <li>Giving presentations to the local education community.</li>
                <li>Making flyers.</li>
                <li>Gaining local media coverage.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            The CastAway satelite will be launched by a small rocket to an altitude of 1000 ft (300 m), 
            from which point it will start collecting data. It will deploy a parachute at its highest 
            altitude, in order to slow its rate of descent to between 10 and 15 m/s (22 and 34 mph).
