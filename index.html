            Man o' War (March 29, 1917 - November 1, 1947) was an American 
            Thoroughbred racehorse who is widely regarded as one of the greatest 
            racehorses of all time. Several sports publications, including The Blood-Horse, 
            Sports Illustrated, and the Associated Press, voted Man o' War as the 
            best American racehorse of the 20th century. During his racing career, 
            just after World War I, Man o' War won 20 of 21 races and $249,465 (equivalent 
            to $3,916,000 in 2024) in purses. He was the unofficial 1920 American horse of 
            the year and was honored with Babe Ruth as the outstanding athlete of the year 
            by The New York Times. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and 
            Hall of Fame in 1957. On March 29, 2017, the museum opened a special exhibit in 
            his honor, "Man o' War at 100". <br><br>

            In 1919, Man o' War won 9 of 10 starts, including the Hopeful Stakes and Belmont Futurity, 
            then the most important races for two-year-old horses in the United States. His only loss came at 
            Saratoga Race Course, later nicknamed the Graveyard of Champions, where he lost by a neck to a colt 
            fittingly named Upset. <br><br>

            Man o' War was not entered in the 1920 Kentucky Derby because his owner, Samuel Riddle, 
            did not believe in racing at the distance of ten furlongs (2,000 m) (one mile and a quarter) 
            so early in a young horse's career. Instead, Man o' War made his three-year-old debut in the 
            Preakness Stakes where he defeated Upset by 1+1/2 lengths. Man o' War later won the Belmont 
            Stakes by 20 lengths while setting a world record. Throughout the summer and fall, he continued 
            to dominate his fellow three-year-olds, setting multiple records while conceding large amounts 
            of weight to his rivals. The only time he faced older horses was in the final race of his career 
            in a match race against Sir Barton, who had won what would later be known as the American Triple 
            Crown in 1919. Man o' War won easily by seven lengths in the first horserace to be filmed in 
            its entirety. <br><br>

            Riddle originally intended to race Man o' War in 1921 but decided against it because Man o' 
            War would have been assigned record weights in the handicap format used in almost all races for older 
            horses at the time. Instead, Man o' War was retired to stud, where he became a leading sire whose multiple 
            champions included Triple Crown winner War Admiral. He was the grandsire of Seabiscuit and his sire line
            continues today through horses such as In Reality, Tiznow, Da' Tara and Tourist. Also successful as a broodmare 
            sire, Man o' War is found in almost all modern American <br><br>

            Background
            Man o' War was a chestnut horse with a white star and stripe on his forehead. He was foaled at Nursery Stud 
            near Lexington, Kentucky.[2] He was bred by August Belmont Jr., whose father's accomplishments were recognized 
            through the naming of the Belmont Stakes in 1867. Belmont Jr. was an equally notable horseman who served as the 
            chairman of The Jockey Club from 1895 until his death in 1924. Belmont Park was named in the family's honor when 
            it opened in 1905.[3] <br><br>


            Man o' War at Nursery Stud
            Man o' War was sired by Fair Play, a multiple stakes winner who finished second in the 1908 Belmont Stakes to 
            the undefeated Colin.[4] Man o' War was the second foal out of Mahubah, a lightly raced mare by English Triple 
            Crown Champion Rock Sand.[5] Not long after the colt was foaled on March 29, 1917, Belmont Jr. joined the 
            United States Army at age 65 to serve in France during World War I. While he was overseas, his wife named the 
            foal "Man o' War" in honor of her husband.[6] Originally, the Belmonts intended to race Man o' War themselves. 
            However, in the summer of 1918 with the ongoing war effort, they decided to liquidate their racing stable. At 
            the Saratoga yearling sale, Man o' War was sold at a final bid of $5,000 (equivalent to $105,000 in 2024) to 
            Samuel D. Riddle, who brought him to his Glen Riddle Farm near Berlin, Maryland. The underbidder at the auction 
            was Robert L. Gerry, Sr., who is reported to have said to his wife, "Forty-five hundred is enough to spend for 
            any yearling."[7] Two years later in 1920, Riddle declined an offer of $400,000 for the horse.[8] <br><br>

            At maturity, Man o' War stood 16.2 1/2 hands (66.5 inches, 169 cm), with prominent withers and a high croup, but 
            was sometimes faulted for a dipped back that grew more pronounced with age. He had virtually flawless legs and 
            solid bone, traits he passed on to his offspring. He had a slightly Roman nose and notably high head carriage.[9] 
            His nickname was "Big Red", though his coat had tinges of yellow and gold. An energetic, spirited horse, he is 
            often pictured standing very still and gazing off into the distance,[10] described as the "look of eagles".[11] 
            His stride was measured at 28 feet and, to this day, is believed to still be the longest of all time.[12] <br><br>

            Racing career <br>

            Silks of Samuel Riddle <br><br>
            Man o' War was the odds-on favorite in every start of his career and justified that faith even in his sole defeat. 
            He typically won in front-running fashion and was only closely pushed in two of his starts. He won the Belmont Stakes 
            by twenty lengths and the Lawrence Realization by a hundred lengths. He set record times in both of those races plus 
            many more at distances ranging from 6 to 13 furlongs (1,200–2,600 m). In many of his starts, he won under heavy 
            restraint and often conceded his rivals large amounts of weight.[10][9] He retired as the then-leading money-earner 
            in American history.[13] <br><br>

            Developing this talent was not easy for trainer Louis Feustel due to Man o' War's occasionally wild temperament. In 
            his early days, Man o' War would routinely dump his exercise riders, once getting free for over 15 minutes after a 
            morning workout. "He fought like a tiger," Riddle later recalled. "He screamed with rage and fought us so hard that 
            it took several days before he could be handled with safety." Feustel brought the colt along slowly and gradually 
            settled him into a regular routine.[12] Man o' War developed a strong bond with his groom Frank Loftus, who taught 
            the horse to fetch and to carry his hat. Oranges were Man o' War's favorite treat.[14] <br><br>

            1919: Two-year-old seasonbr <br>
            Man o' War made his debut at Belmont Park on June 6, 1919, in a maiden race over five furlongs (1,000 m). At the time, 
            horses raced clockwise at Belmont Park rather than counter-clockwise like all the other American tracks of the day, so 
            horses had to learn to race in both directions. This practice ended in 1922 after Man o' War retired.[15] He won his 
            first race by six lengths, then three days later was entered in the Keene Memorial Stakes at a distance of 5+1⁄2 furlongs 
            (1,100 m) on a muddy track at Belmont Park. At this point in his career, Man o' War had not yet learned how to start 
            quickly but soon settled into fourth place. With an eighth of a mile remaining, jockey Johnny Loftus urged him to run 
            and the horse responded by pulling away from his rivals to win by three lengths.[16] Twelve days later, Man o' War 
            followed up with another win in the Youthful Stakes at Jamaica Race Course. Two days after that, he swept to victory in 
            the Hudson Stakes at Aqueduct to record his fourth win in 18 days. Less than two weeks later, he returned to win the 
            Tremont Stakes at Aqueduct on July 5.[17] <br><br>

            He was then shipped upstate for the summer meet at Saratoga Race Course, where the competition would be much fiercer. 
            He made his first appearance there in the United States Hotel Stakes on August 2. Despite getting a bad start and 
            carrying 130 pounds, Man o' War won by two lengths in his first meeting with a well-regarded colt named Upset.[18] <br><br>


            Man o' War suffers his sole defeat to Upset in the Sanford Stakes <br>
            His next start was the Sanford Memorial Stakes on August 13, where he went off as the odds-on favorite with Upset as the 
            third betting choice. This race is notorious in racing history as Man o' War's only defeat, playing a part in developing 
            Saratoga's reputation as the "Graveyard of Champions".[19] In the early 1900s, there were no starting gates. Horses circled 
            around and then lined up behind a piece of webbing known as the barrier and were sent away when it was raised.[20] In the 
            Sanford, most sources state that Man o' War was still circling with his back to the starting line when the barrier was raised 
            (though some accounts say he was turned only slightly sideways).[21] What is undisputed is that Man o' War had a terrible 
            start, which The New York Times attributed to the absence of the regular starting official. The start was delayed for several 
            minutes as other colts repeatedly broke through the barrier and the starter finally released the field when only the horses 
            near the rail were ready. As a result, Man o' War was far behind the other starters. Loftus then put him in a bad position, 
            getting boxed in by other horses, then checked by tiring horses. Despite this, Man o' War came close to winning, losing by 
            about a neck[a] while conceding 15 pounds to Upset.[17][22][23] <br><br>


            It is sometimes erroneously thought that Upset's unexpected win popularized a new phrase in sports (meaning an underdog beating 
            the favorite) – in fact, the term "upset" had been in use to describe such a situation for decades. The two horses faced off 
            five times during their racing careers, with Man o' War beating Upset four times.[24][23] <br><br>

            The loss only enhanced Man o' War's reputation. J.L. Dempsey of The Daily Racing Form wrote, "Without attempting to detract 
            from the merits of [Upset's] performance, Man o' War proved himself in the running unquestionably the best. It was Upset's 
            advantage at the start, coupled with 15 pounds weight concession, a perfect ride he received from Knapp and his success in 
            saving ground on the stretch turn that brought his triumph over Man o' War. Had the race been a sixteenth farther the finish 
            would have been reversed."[17] <br><br>

            Man o' War gained his revenge with a victory in the Grand Union Hotel Stakes on August 23, beating Upset by two lengths with 
            Blazes in third. After the race, Loftus stated that Man o' War was the best horse he had ever ridden and that his ride had been 
            responsible for the loss in the Sanford.[25] While carrying 130 pounds, Man o' War tied the stakes record[b] of 1:12 2/5 for 
            six furlongs (1,200 m) that had been set by Garbage while carrying only 107 pounds (49 kg).[26] <br><br>

            Seven days later, Man o' War entered the Hopeful Stakes, whose purse of $30,000 made it one of the richest prizes in racing 
            at the time. He faced eight rivals, a small field at the time for such a prestigious race. Heavy rain started to fall as the 
            field headed to the starting post, and Man o' War broke through the barrier several times, delaying the race by twelve minutes. 
            Despite this, he won with "ridiculous ease" by six lengths.[27] <br><br>

            Man o' War then returned to Belmont Park for the Futurity Stakes on September 14. The Futurity had a purse of $5,000 added, 
            meaning the prize money was increased by nomination and entry fees. Because the Futurity was one of the preeminent races of 
            the day, the added money was large enough to increase the winner's share of the purse to $26,650.[c] Man o' War briefly dueled 
            or the lead with a well-regarded sprinter named Dominique, then opened up a commanding lead. Turning into the stretch, John P. 
            Grier swept into second with an all-out drive but failed to make up any ground on Man o' War, who had not been urged at any point 
            in the race and won by three lengths while carrying 127 pounds, 10 pounds more than John P. Grier. Journalists, horsemen, and fans 
            agreed that Man o' War had to be considered as one of the greatest American horses of his age, and they compared him favorably to 
            the unbeaten Colin. He completed his two-year-old campaign with nine wins from ten starts and earnings of $82,275.[28] He was 
            named the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt of 1919. He was rated at 136 pounds by handicapper C.C. Ridley of the Daily Racing 
            Form, 16 pounds ahead of the second-ranked colt, Blazes.[9] <br>

            1920: Three-year-old season
            In 1920, Johnny Loftus was denied a renewal of his jockey's license by The Jockey Club, a development that was rumored to be 
            related to Man o' War's defeat in the Sanford.[12] He was replaced as the colt's rider by Clarence Kummer. Over the winter, 
            Man o' War had grown to 16.2 hands (66 inches, 168 cm) high and filled out to about 1,150 pounds (520 kg) with a 72 inches 
            (180 cm) girth.[29] <br><br>


            Man o' War at age three
            Riddle decided early on to restrict Man o' War to races within his own age division, in large part because the most valuable races in the 
            country were restricted to three-year-olds. He decided not to enter him in the Kentucky Derby because it was run only a few days before 
            his preferred target, the Preakness Stakes, which was held close to the Riddle farm where Man o' War had spent the winter.[30] Riddle also 
            did not like racing in Kentucky and believed it was too early in the year for a young horse to go a mile and a quarter. Thus, Man o' War 
            did not have a chance to complete what later became known as the U.S. Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, consisting of the Kentucky 
            Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes. The previous year, Sir Barton had won the three races, which gained in prestige and importance 
            10 years later when Gallant Fox accomplished the same feat under a great deal of <br>
